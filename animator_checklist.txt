############################################################
As in the modeler project, we use the Assimp library.

please make sure you place assimp-vc142-mt.dll (can be found in the root directory) 
under the same path of the executive. 

The linker should link to the additional library under ./lib and the include directories 
should contain ./assimp-5.0.1

(By default all the above have already be done if you open the project using VS)
