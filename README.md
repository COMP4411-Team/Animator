# Animator

* [ ] W (at most 3W) Enhance the required spline options.
  
* [ ] W Extends your project so that it support the use of the transparent TGA files.
  
* [ ] W Render a mirror in your scene. Extra whistle: clip the reflected image to the mirror's surface.
  
* [ ] W Billboarding.

* [ ] W for each. Use billborading to render fire, snow, water fountain, fireworks.
  
* [ ] W Use environment mapping to simulate a reflective material.
  
* [ ] W Motion blur.
  
* [ ] W Skybox.
  
* [ ] W Use a higher-order method such as the Runge-Kutta technique.
  
* [ ] W Use OpenGL display lists to speed up the rendering.
  
* [ ] W Implement adaptive BÃ©zier curve generation. Extra whistle for visual controls to toggle the feature, modify the flatness parameter (with a slider for e.g.) and show the number of points generated for each curve.
  
* [ ] B Extend the particle system to handle springs. For one more bell, implement spring-based cloth. For 2 more bells, implement spring-based fur.
  
* [ ] B Allow for particles to bounce off each other.
  
* [ ] B Implement a "general" subdivision curve.

* [ ] B Heightfields.
  
* [ ] B Extend your metaballs so that it support environment mapping.
  
* [ ] 1B1W Add a lens flare. Extra whistle for handling occluded light source.
  
* [ ] 1B1W Improve UI.

* [ ] 2B Add flocking behaviors to your particles to simulate creatures moving in flocks, herds, or schools. For up to one more bell, make realistic creature model and have it move realistically according to its motion path.
  
* [x] 2B Implement a C2-Interpolating curve.
  
* [ ] 2B Add the ability to edit Catmull-Rom curves.
  
* [ ] 2B Implement picking of a part in the model hierarchy.
  
* [ ] 2B Implement Quaternions as a method for avoiding the gimbal lock.
  
* [ ] 2B Draw bspline surface in the 3D scene. In this extension, you are required to allow user to adjust the control points.
  
* [ ] 3B Implement projected textures. One extra bell for projected shadows.
  
* [ ] 3B Support motion warping.
  
* [ ] 3B Implement Cel Shading.
  
* [ ] 4B Simulate rigid-body.
  
* [ ] 4B Support subdivision surfaces.
  
* [ ] 8B(?) Inverse kinematics.
  
* [ ] 8B(?) Interactive control of physically-based animation.
